# Integrated Design and Operation Model for NGCC-PCC-DAC Retrofit

This repo contains the optimization model for the NGCC-PCC-DAC retrofit design modeled in `Julia/Jump` and `Python/Pyomo`.

## Main features
- co-optimizes the design and operational decisions
- considers multiple future energy scenarios (varying electricity prices for a year + varying CO2 prices)
- formulates a novel DAC model to account for sorbent dynamics
- contains logic for system start-up/shutdown

For the full model description, please contact [Pengfei Cheng](pengfeicheng@gatech.edu).

## Branches

Currently there are 4 branches:
- `main`: the most up-to-date one with all the features
- `base-NGCC`: contains the optimization model for the operations of B31A (unretrofitted NGCC)
- `pyomo-ver`: the identical model formulated in `Python/Pyomo`
- `pyomo-SP`: the stochastic version of the model in in `Python/Pyomo`

## Installation

### `Python` Environment
To install required packages, run
```shell
pip install -r requirements.text
```

### Optimization solver
To use a certain MILP solver, please install it separately.

## Usage

To directly run the model, simply execute `model.py`.

To run the model in a Jupyter notebook for exploratory programming, run:
```Python
from src.pyomo_model.model import *
```

### Configure scenarios

To configure energy scenarios, see the comments in `model.py`.
